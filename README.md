# Word-summarizer

This project provides a Python script to summarize text documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The script utilizes the NLTK library for text preprocessing and Gensim's TF-IDF model for scoring and ranking sentences to generate a concise summary of the input text.

1.INSTALLATION

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd text-summarization
```

Install dependencies:

You can install the required Python libraries using pip

```bash
pip install nltk genism
```

Download NLTK resources:

The script requires specific NLTK resources. These can be downloaded using:
```bash
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```


2.USAGE

Prepare your text file:

Ensure you have a text file with the content you want to summarize. Update the file_path variable in the script with the path to your text file.


Run the script:

Execute the Python script to generate a summary of the text file:

```bash
python summarize.py
```

The script will read the content from the specified file, process it, and print the summary to the console.

3.DEPENDENCIES

* nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing and tokenization.
* gensim: Library for topic modeling and document similarity, used here for TF-IDF modeling.

4.HOW IT WORKS

1.Text Preprocessing:

Tokenizes text into sentences and words.
Removes stop words and punctuation.
Stems words to their root forms.

2.TF-IDF Modeling:

Converts preprocessed text into TF-IDF vectors.
Scores sentences based on their TF-IDF values.

3.Summarization:

Ranks sentences by their scores.
Selects and concatenates the top-ranked sentences to create a summary.
